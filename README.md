# 🤖 E-Yantra 2024 — Balancing Builder Bot

Welcome to my submission for **E-Yantra Robotics Competition 2024**, developed under the theme **Balancing Builder Bot**. This repository contains all the code, simulations, and documentation related to my solution.

## 🛠️ Theme Overview: Balancing Builder Bot
The challenge revolves around building a bot capable of stacking blocks while maintaining dynamic balance. It merges the principles of robotics, control systems, and real-time decision-making in a constrained physical environment.

## 🚧 Problem Statement
Design and implement a bot that can:
- Navigate a structured arena
- Pick and place blocks to build towers
- Maintain balance despite structural changes
- Respond intelligently to shifts in terrain or load

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used
- PID Control for Balance Management
- Real-time Sensor Integration (IMU, Encoders)
- Inverse Kinematics for Robotic Arm Movement
- Finite State Machines for Task Sequencing
- Arena Mapping and Grid-based Navigation


## 📦 Tools and Tech Used
- **CoppeliaSim** for simulation
- **Python** for logic and control algorithms
- **MATLAB / SciPy** (optional analysis)
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD (planned)

## 📝 Contributions
This project was developed as part of the E-Yantra Competition hosted by **IIT Bombay**. It reflects my learning in robotics, system design, and debugging under pressure.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- How to tune control systems under noisy feedback
- Importance of modular code design in robotics
- Collaborative problem-solving in time-sensitive environments
